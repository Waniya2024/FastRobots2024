                            <p>The basic “Blink” example is used to test the LED on the module and make sure that the code can be correctly uploaded to the board. The “Blink” code first sets the pin connected to the LED to HIGH for one second, and then sets the pin to LOW for another second. These two processes are repeated in a loop to achieve the blinking effect.</p>

                            <p>The “Example4_Serial” code is used to test the serial communication between the computer and the Artemis board. In the following example, the Artemis board first sends a counting test to the serial monitor through UART communication. Then, it allows the user to send a string from the computer, and the Artemis board can echo whatever that was sent to the serial monitor. This showcast that serial communication is correctly set up between the computer and the Artemis module.</p>

In the following video, a tone is produced that plays from low to high frequencies. It can be observed that the frequency of the environmental voice that was printed on the serial monitor gradually increases and can match with the frequency of the tone that was being played.</p>

Whereas the second method in Task 5 first collects data in an array and then sends them to the computer as a package. Since the Artemis board has 384kB of RAM, the maximum number of 16-bit data it can hold is 192000 assuming that the entirety of the Artemis RAM is used to store transmission data. Therefore, the estimated time before RAM runs out is 6’24’’ if the sampling rate is 500Hz, and 32 minutes if the sampling rate is 100Hz.</p>

The effective data rate is 42 data per second for a 5-byte reply, and is 991 data per second for a 120-byte reply. As it can aslo be observed that the effective data rate would increase as the message size increases. This shows that short packets introduce more overhead, and larger replies can reduce overhead. </p>

                            The 9DoF IMU module 'ICM-20948' is hooked up to the Artemis board through a QWIIC connector. And the ICM 20948 library from SparkFun should be installed to set up the IMU in Arduino IDE. The example code “Example1_Basics” is a good demonstration of getting the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass data from the IMU module. In the example code, the ‘AD0_VAL’ variable should be changed from 1 to 0. The ‘AD0_VAL’ represents the last bit of the I2C address in the IMU, and should be set to zero when the ADR jumper is closed. As shown in the figure below, the ADR jumper is connected on the board and the I2C communication address is 0x68.

                            <p>To find out how much the noise would affect the accelerometer measurement, a fourier transform could be applied to analyze the amount of noise present in high frequencies. 800 sets of data were collected within 6 seconds at a sample rate of 134.8 samples per second. The IMU was also performing some simple acceleration motions when the data was collected. The collected signals in time and frequency domains are plotted in the following figures.</p>

                            <p>The frequency spectrum shows that the magnitude of signal at frequencies less than 5Hz is much larger than that of the high frequency. To further verify the result, a low pass filter was implemented on the accelerometer data. The cutoff frequency of a LPF is typically equal to or less than half the sampling rate. This is because the sampling frequency is larger than (or equal to) twice the maximum frequency of the signal to avoid aliasing. Therefore, half of the sampling rate is a good cutoff frequency to reconstruct the signal. If the cutoff frequency is too high, the LSP is not sufficient to eliminate all the replicates of the spectrum outside the baseband. And if the cutoff frequency is too low, the signal could not be well reconstructed and its shape distorted. The equations for a digital LPF is shown below:</p>

                            <p>The gyroscope could also be used to calculate the pitch, roll, and yaw of an object. Instead of returning the absolute angle like the accelerometer, the gyroscope could only measure the rate of angular change. And the angles are computed by accumulating the gyro readings with respect to time.</p>
                            <img src="assets/img/Lab2/Gyro_equ.png" width="300" height="100">
                            <p>Several tests were conducted to determine the appropriate sampling frequency. It was discovered that higher sampling frequencies result in greater accuracy. When the sampling frequency is too low, the collected samples may not adequately track the motion of the object, particularly when it undergoes frequent changes in movement. A test was conducted where the object was pitched from 0 to 90 degrees five times. It was observed that the data sampled at 10Hz exhibited higher accuracy compared to that collected at 2Hz.</p>

                            <p>Although the gyroscope is less affected by noise, the angular data would drift overtime because they are computed based on accumulation of past data. A way to combine the advantage of these two sensors into design a complementary filter and fuse these two sensors. A parameter ‘alpha’ is used as a weighting factor to balance the data collected from the accelerometer and the gyroscope. In this example, the weight for accelerometer alpha was determined to be 0.1, this enables the drift from gyroscope to be corrected by the accelerometer.</p>
                            <img src="assets/img/Lab2/Com_Filt_Equ.png" width="500" height="80">
                            <p>However, since the yaw angle cannot be derived from the accelerometer, its drift cannot be corrected. As shown in the figures below, the angels measured by the gyro alone have a drift for more than 15 degrees within 60 seconds. Whereas, the pitch and roll angles measured by fused sensors did not produce any significant drift.</p>

                            <p>To transmit the data between the Artemis and the host computer with a higher sampling rate, a few adjustments were made. Firstly, instead of sending the data through bluetooth each time when they were collected, sampled data should be stored to  separated arrays for storing timestamps, accelerometer, and gyroscope. Secondly, all the unnecessary delays and serial.print statements should be removed from the loop that collects the data. To store more arrays in limited RAM, timestamps were stored as int; accelerometer and gyroscope data were stored as floats. The following screenshot shows that 1000 sets of data were sampled and transmitted to the computer within 7.189 seconds, with a sample rate of 139.1Hz. That is, each dataset was sampled at an average of 7.189ms.</p>

                            <p>However, storing 1000-datasets is not the limit for Artemis. One dataset contains one integer and 6 floats, that is 26 bytes each dataset. Assuming that up to 80% of dynamic memory in the Artemis could be used to store these arrays, a total of 307.2kB could be used (out of 384kB). Theoretically, 11815 sets of data could be stored.</p>
